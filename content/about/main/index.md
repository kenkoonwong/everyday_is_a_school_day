  Anyone who has ever tried to learn something new knows that it is not always easy. Oftentimes, it takes a lot of effort and motivation just to get started. However, the process of learning can be made more enjoyable if it is self-motivated, taken in small chunks, and if failure is okay. 
  
  When we are self-motivated to learn something, it means that we are interested in it and want to learn more about it. This makes the process more enjoyable because we are doing it for ourselves and not just because someone else wants us to. 
  
  Breaking learning down into small chunks also makes it more manageable and less daunting. 
  
  And finally, accepting that failure is okay helps to take the pressure off and makes learning more fun. After all, the whole point is to try something new and see where it takes us.
