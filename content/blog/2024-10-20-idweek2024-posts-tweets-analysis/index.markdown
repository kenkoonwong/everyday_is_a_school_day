## Post counts by days {#count}
![](posts_days.png)
> We had the least tweet counts this year when compared to 2023 and 2022! 

Very interesting. When compared to IDweek [2022](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/idweek2022/) and [2023](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/idweek2023/), there is a difference in post peaks. This year it appears more consistent throughout whereas last year was bimodal and the year before it peaked on Friday. This year it also appeared to have less posts were compared to 2022 and 2023. We had a total of 1674 posts this year, in 2023 we had 2627 posts, and in 2022 it was ~2188. That's quite a huge drop in posts/tweets. Did I not capture them all? I double checked the code and re-queried it, it's still the same.

IDWeek opened with a bang! It's BALANCE trial !!! Treating hospitalized patients with bloodstream infections with antibiotics for seven days is just as effective as a 14-day treatment regimen. The study compared the safety and effectiveness of antibiotic courses in 3,608 patients with bloodstream infections across 74 hospitals in seven countries. Both treatment durations demonstrated similar 90-day mortality rates during the study period. Excluded Staph aureus, S lugdunensis, Candida, deep seated infections, severe immunocompromised. 

From the wisdom of the crowd, you can see more details #IDTwitter Peeps posted regarding BALANCE. Thank you all!

I'll list a few that I thought were interesting and something new for me. We'll skip BALANCE, since we've already talked about it above.

The 2nd most bookmarked tweet made me look at what's been discussed with Metformin and I found this `Metformin reduces the risk of Long COVID or Death over 6 months in an Emulated Target Trial of Primarily Omicron-infected Adults without Diabetes or Prediabetes: a New-User, Active-Comparator Analysis Using the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Electronic Health Record Database` by [Carolyn T. Bramante](https://twitter.com/BramanteCarolyn)

STOP-CDI trial by UPenn is interesting transplant/CART admissions screened for C diff colonization -> contact precautions and po vanco prophy. Reduced odds of CDI and LOS! Thanks CalderwoodMD for posting this info!

[A nice non-partisan view of side by side comparison of the health policies of the two presidential candidates most relevant to ID physicians](https://www.hivma.org/globalassets/hivma/rwmpc-hivma_whats-at-stake-2024-election-fact-sheet_final.pdf) below is a snapshot of the first page of pdf

Interesting presentation on empyema treatment duration. Guidelines gives duration recommendations of 2-6 weeks, with most patients receiving 3-4 weeks in clinical practice. SLIM (Open label RCT, excluded RAPID score >4 high risk) showed no difference in treatment failure, though n of 50? üßê. There was a comment that maybe 2 weeks would be OK for certain population.

## World Map Of X Users Posted #IDWeek2024 
![](world.png)
Wow, very diverse and international indeed! I'm impressed by the global involvement at an Infectious Disease conference. Wisdom of the crowd! I tried making a gradient color but it may be too hard to differentiate the frequencies of users when the color is subtle, hence I used solid different color for representation so that we can see the difference. If the picture is too small, right click on the picture and then click on "Open Image in New Tab", it should give you a bigger picture for details. What about United States? Which states are those 103 users from? Or at least where they listed they're from ü§£

## USA Map Of X Users Posted #IDWeek2024 

![](state.png)
This is so awesome! Even though the conference was in LA, attendees from all over USA traveled and attended the conference! Or at least that was the inference was. Very cool! Keep up the great work #IDSA!

## Limitations {#limit}
- Posts are limited only if there is an #IDweek2024 or idweek keyword on the tweet. We may have missed quite a bit. 
- Posts frequncies weren't as robust as last year or the year before, but still good information!
- World and USA state map frequencies were curated from X user data which may not be completely accurate. We had about 22% missing data, and possibly some percentage of inaccurate / gibberish location data. Also these were parsed by LLM, which is great !!!

## Lessons Learnt
- Balance RCT has been the hot topic
- learnt geom_sf and geom_sf_text
- used LLM to parse locations
