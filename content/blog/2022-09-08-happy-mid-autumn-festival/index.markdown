The Mid-Autumn Festival is a time for celebration in China. The festival celebrates the end of harvest season and symbolizes new life with its sweet mooncakes that are often enjoyed while watching an autumn sky filled stars come out at nightfall on this blessed day! 

<br>

It is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture. It's popularity equals that seen with New Year and it has a history dating back 3 thousand years! On this day, there will be an autumn full moon ðŸŒ• at night which corresponds to September through October on our calendar

The Moon is a symbol of family and reunion, which makes it an important part in many cultures' celebrations. The bright roundness suggests peace as well since that's what we all want!

One of the things I love most about mid-autumn festival is the moon cakes. They are round or square cakes that are made with different fillings, such as lotus seed paste or red bean paste. They are very dense, sweat and delicious!

# Happy Mid-autumn Festival!
