## What is interaction?
In statistics, interaction refers to the phenomenon where the effect of one variable on an outcome is influenced by the presence or change in another variable. It indicates that the relationship between variables is not simply additive, but rather depends on the interaction between their values. Understanding interactions is crucial for capturing complex relationships and building accurate predictive models that consider the combined influence of variables, providing deeper insights into data analysis across various fields. 

Still don't understand? No worries, you're not alone. I've been there too! However, I found that simulating and visualizing interactions really helped solidify my understanding of their significance. Missing out on understanding interactions is like skipping a few chapters in the story ‚Äì it's an essential part of grasping the whole picture.    

## Simulate interaction
```{r,message=F,warning=F}
library(tidymodels)
library(tidyverse)
library(bonsai)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggpubr)

set.seed(1)
n <- 1000
x1 <- rnorm(n)
x2 <- rnorm(n)
x3 <- rnorm(n)
y1 <- 0.2*x1 + rnorm(n)
y2 <- 1 + 0.6*x2 + rnorm(n)
y3 <- 2 + -0.2*x3 + rnorm(n)

# combining all y_i to 1 vector
y <- c(y1,y2,y3)

# categorize x1, x2, and x3
df <- tibble(y=y,x=c(x1,x2,x3),x_i=c(rep("x1",n),rep("x2",n),rep("x3",n))) 

kable(df |> head(5))
```

But hold on, Ken, that's not interaction, right? Doesn't interaction involve terms like `y = x + w + x*w`? Well, yes, you're right about that equation, but the explanation above offers a more intuitive grasp of what interaction entails. It's like taking the nominal categories `x1, x2, x3`, treating them as on-off switches, and then consolidating all three equations into one primary equation. This approach helps in calculating the interrelationships between them. Trust me. Also this was a great [resource](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/interactions.html) in understanding the interaction formula too. 

This is essentially our formula:     

$Y_i = B_0 + B_1X_{1i} + B_2X_{2i} + B_3X_{3i} + B_4X_{1i}X_{2i} + B_5X_{1i}X_{3i} + e_i$.   

Wow, there are too many $B$'s. I can see why it is hard to follow. We'll carry this formula with us and unpack it later on.    

## Visualize interaction
```{r,message=F,warning=F}
df |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y,color=as.factor(x_i))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Wow, look at those slopes of `x1, x2, x3`. We can all agree that they all have different `intercepts` and `slopes`. That my friend, is interaction.

## True Model ‚úÖ
```{r}
model_true <- lm(y~x*x_i,df)
summary(model_true)
```

#### Intercepts of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`
![](intercept.png)
Notice that the first intercept is the first equation of `y1 = x1 + noise` and the intercept should be zero, or at least close to zero. The second intercept is `x2`'s. Notice that in the equation that simulates the data has a `1` as intercept? Where does this recide in the true model? Yes you're right, on `x_ix2` ! It's not `1` but it's close to `1`. And the third intercept for `x3` is on `x_ix3`. 

What if intercept for `x1` is not zero? Read on below.

#### Slopes of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`
![](slope.png)
What about the slopes? the slope for `x1` is on `x`, `x2` is on `x:x_ix2`, `x3` is on `x:x_ix3`. The interaction is the slope! How cool! Wait, you may say, they don't add up! `x2` coefficient should be `0.6` but why is `x:x_ix2` about `0.22` less? Wait a minute, does `0.22` of coefficient look familiar to you? It's `x1`'s coefficient (or in this case listed as `x`).     

Wowowow, hold the phone, so the slopes for `x2` is the sum of `x1` coefficient and `x:x_ix2` the interaction term !?! YES, precisely! And the same would be for `x3` too? Let's do the math, `0.224 + (-0.397) = -0.173` which is very close to `-0.2` which is the true `x3` coefficient! And you can even see the `negative slope` from the visualization too (represented by blue color). Superb! üôå

So, if the intercept `x1` is not zero, it's the same thing as the `slope` coefficients, you just simply add them up! How neat to be able to combine all 3 equations (of the same measurements of course, meaning y and x are measuring the same things) into 1 equation! 


## Wrong Model ‚ùå
```{r}
model_wrong <- lm(y~x + x_i,df)
summary(model_wrong)
```

Notice that if we only naively model `y` and `x` relationship without taking account to the interaction terms, we're not seeing the whole picture. We'll be missing out the actual `slopes` and falsely thinking that `x_ix3` is the slope, when it is supposed to be negative. 

If we were to visualize it would be something like this 
```{r}
df |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y,color=x_i)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = model_wrong$coefficients[[1]], slope = model_wrong$coefficients[["x"]], color = "red") +
  geom_abline(intercept = model_wrong$coefficients[[1]], slope = model_wrong$coefficients[["x_ix2"]], color = "green") +
  geom_abline(intercept = model_wrong$coefficients[[1]], slope = model_wrong$coefficients[["x_ix3"]], color = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Doesn't look right, does it?

## What is S Learner?
S-learner is one of the early Machine Learning Meta-learners that can be used for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) in causal inference. The simplest in my opinion, which is great, makes us understand the other Meta-learners better, such as T, X, R, DL, after understanding how to construct this one first. We basically take `treatment` variable just like any other covariate, train the model with a machine learning model of your choice, and then use that to estimate CATE, all in ONE model! 

Response function:    
$\mu(x,z) := \mathbb{E}(Y^{obs}|X=x,Z=z)$

Estimate CATE by:     
$\hat{t}(x) =  \mu(X=1,Z=z) - \mu(X=0, Z=z)$

`$\mu$`: Model of choice.   
`Y`: Outcome.   
`X`: binary treatment variable.   
`Z`: other covariates. Though, we don't have any in our current simulation.     
`$\hat{t}$`: CATE

For excellent explaination on S-learner please check this [link](https://muestrear-no-es-pecado.netlify.app/2020/12/30/y-si-parte-ii/#s-learner) by Jos√© Luis Ca√±adas Reche and this [link](https://statisticaloddsandends.wordpress.com/2022/05/20/t-learners-s-learners-and-x-learners/) on Statistical Odds & Ends.       

## What is CATE?
Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is a foundational concept in causal inference, focusing on the difference in expected outcomes between individuals who receive a treatment and those who do not, while considering their unique characteristics or covariates. Representing the average impact of treatment while accounting for individual differences, CATE helps answer how treatments influence outcomes in a given context. It's calculated as the difference between the expected outcomes under treatment and no treatment conditions for individuals with specific covariate values, providing crucial insights into causal relationships and guiding decision-making across various domains.    

## Boost Tree Model
I'm a great supporter of tidymodels. In this context, we'll utilize this framework to apply boosting tree methods and determine whether they can reveal interaction terms without requiring explicit specification. For S-learner, we basically will use a model, train with all data, then use the model to calculate CATE.    

#### Light GBM
```{r, message=F,warning=F}
#split
# split <- initial_split(df, prop = 0.8)
# train <- training(split)
# test <- testing(split)

#preprocess
rec <- recipe(y ~ ., data = df) |>
  step_dummy(all_nominal())

rec |> prep() |> juice() |> head(5) |> kable()

#cv
cv <- vfold_cv(data = df, v = 5, repeats = 5)

#engine
gbm <- boost_tree() |>
  set_engine("lightgbm") |>
  set_mode("regression")


#workflow
gbm_wf <- workflow() |>
  add_recipe(rec) |>
  add_model(gbm)

#assess
gbm_assess <- gbm_wf %>%
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = cv,
    metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq, ccc),
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
  )

gbm_assess |>
  collect_metrics() |> kable()

#fit
gbm_fit <- gbm_wf |>
  fit(df)
```

Alright, let's use default hyperparameters without tuning `lightbgm` and see how things go. Observe that during our preprocessing, we did not specify interaction terms such as `y ~ x*x_i`.        

Let's look at our True Model CATE of `x2` comparing to `x1` when `x` is `3` ‚úÖ
```{r}
predict(model_true, newdata=tibble(x=3,x_i="x2")) - predict(model_true, newdata=tibble(x=3,x_i="x1")) 
```

Let's look at our Wrong Model CATE of `x2` comparing to `x1` when `x` is `3` ‚ùå
```{r}
predict(model_wrong, newdata=tibble(x=3,x_i="x2")) - predict(model_wrong, newdata=tibble(x=3,x_i="x1")) 
```

Let's look at LightGBM CATE of `x2` comparing to `x1` when `x` is `3`. üå∏
```{r}
predict(gbm_fit, new_data=tibble(x=3,x_i="x2")) - predict(gbm_fit, new_data=tibble(x=3,x_i="x1")) 
```

Wow, LightGBM is quite close to the tru model. Let's sequence a vector of `x` and assess all 3 models.    
```{r, message=F,warning=F}
# write a function
assess <- function(model,x,x_i,x_base="x1") {
  if (class(model)!="workflow") {
    diff <- predict(model, newdata=tibble(x=!!x,x_i=!!x_i)) - predict(model, newdata=tibble(x=!!x,x_i=x_base))
  } else { 
  diff <- (predict(model, new_data=tibble(x=!!x,x_i=!!x_i)) - predict(model, new_data=tibble(x=!!x,x_i=x_base))) |> pull() }
  return(tibble(x=!!x,diff=diff))
}

# sequence of x's
x <- seq(-3,3,0.1)

# type of x_i of interest
x_i <- "x2"

gbm_g<- assess(model=gbm_fit,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point() +
  # geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("LightGBM") +
  ylab("CATE")

true_g <- assess(model=model_true,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point()  +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Linear Model With Interaction Terms") +
  ylab("CATE")

wrong_g <- assess(model=model_wrong,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point()  +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Linear Model Without Interaction Terms") +
  ylab("CATE")

ggarrange(gbm_g,true_g,wrong_g, ncol = 1)

```

Very interesting indeed! `LightGBM` seems to be able to get very similar CATE compared to True model! The sequence of prediction by `LightGBM` also looks quite familiar, doesn't it? If we were to use its prediction regressing on `x`, it looks like the slope might be very similar to the true model. Let's give a a try

#### LightGBM's CATE regressing on `x` 
```{r}
gbm_pred <- assess(gbm_fit, x = x, x_i = "x2")
summary(lm(diff~x,gbm_pred))
```

#### True model's CATE regressing on `x`
```{r, warning=F}
model_true_pred <- assess(model_true, x, "x2")
summary(lm(diff~x,model_true_pred))
```

very very similar indeed! Let's visualize them side by side
```{r,message=F,warning=F}
gbm_g<- assess(model=gbm_fit,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("LightGBM") +
  ylab("CATE")

ggarrange(gbm_g,true_g)
```

What if we look at `x3`?
```{r,message=F,warning=F}
# sequence of x's
x <- seq(-3,3,0.1)

# type of x_i of interest
x_i <- "x3"

gbm_g<- assess(model=gbm_fit,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("LightGBM") +
  ylab("CATE")

true_g <- assess(model=model_true,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point()  +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Linear Model With Interaction Terms") +
  ylab("CATE")

wrong_g <- assess(model=model_wrong,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point()  +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Linear Model Without Interaction Terms") +
  ylab("CATE")

ggarrange(gbm_g,true_g,wrong_g, ncol = 1)
```

  
#### XGBoost
```{r,message=F,warning=F}
gbb <- boost_tree() |>
  set_engine("xgboost") |>
  set_mode("regression")

#workflow
gbb_wf <- workflow() |>
  add_recipe(rec) |>
  add_model(gbb)

#assess
gbb_assess <- gbb_wf %>%
  fit_resamples(
    resamples = cv,
    metrics = metric_set(rmse, rsq, ccc),
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
  )

gbb_assess |>
  collect_metrics() |> kable()

gbb_fit <- gbb_wf |>
  fit(df)

# sequence of x's
x <- seq(-3,3,0.1)

# type of x_i of interest
x_i <- "x2"

gbb_g<- assess(model=gbb_fit,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("LightGBM") +
  ylab("CATE")

true_g <- assess(model=model_true,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point()  +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Linear Model With Interaction Terms") +
  ylab("CATE")

ggarrange(gbb_g,true_g)

x_i <- "x3"

gbb_g<- assess(model=gbb_fit,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method="lm") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("LightGBM") +
  ylab("CATE")

true_g <- assess(model=model_true,x=x,x_i=x_i) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=diff)) +
  geom_point()  +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Linear Model With Interaction Terms") +
  ylab("CATE")

ggarrange(gbb_g,true_g)
```

Not too shabby either!

## Limitation
- We haven't truly added confounders such as `z` to the mix, we'll hae to see how that pans out with interaction. I sense another blog coming up! 
- We may not be actually be using the S-learner method in the right setting. It's usually to assess a binary treatment and its outcome. Here we're focused more on interaction terms and how boost tree can tease that out.

- Thanks to Jos√© Luis Ca√±adas Reche's inspiring S-learner blog, please check this [link](https://muestrear-no-es-pecado.netlify.app/2020/12/30/y-si-parte-ii/#s-learner). I wasn't planning on doing interaction and S-learner at the same time, but this gave me an opportunity. 
- [Barr, Dale J. (2021). Learning statistical models through simulation in R: An interactive textbook](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/interactions.html) really helped me to understand interaction
- Last but not least, [Aleksander Molak's book](https://www.amazon.com/Causal-Inference-Discovery-Python-learning/dp/1804612987) is awesome and learnt about Meta-learners.    

## Lessons Learnt
- `geom_abline` to draw custom line based on intercept + slopes
- `\mathbb{E}` symbol for Expected in LaTeX
- Gradient boosting models such as `lightGBM` can tease out interaction, quite a handy tool! 
- Learnt what interaction is and how to interpret its summary
- Learnt S-learner
