excerpt: Wow, what a journey, and more to come! We learned how to perform simple RAG with an LLM and even ventured into LangChain territory. It wasn't as scary as some people said! The documentation is fantastic. Best of all, we did it ALL in R with Reticulate, without leaving RStudio! Not only we can read IDSA Guidelines, we can use LLM to assist us with retrieving information!

> Wow, what a journey, and more to come! We learned how to perform simple RAG with an LLM and even ventured into LangChain territory. It wasn‚Äôt as scary as some people said! The documentation is fantastic. Best of all, we did it ALL in R with Reticulate, without leaving RStudio! Not only we can read IDSA Guidelines, we can use LLM to assist us with retrieving information!

## TL;DR

I think everyone should learn the intuition of LLM, prompt engineering, RAG, agents, etc. The concept itself and with some trial and error will provide users a renewed perspective of how these things work, how helpful and beneficial it can be for us, how it serves as a tool for learning and not a replacement. **The simplest & most straightforward way of learning is using GPT4All GUI** **LangChain‚Äôs tutorial, use a Local LLM, and then give it a go!** Yes most of these are in `python` but it shouldn‚Äôt prevent R user like me to use it in `R` via `reticulate`!

## Motivation

I have been wanting to learn LLM for a while now. My first attempt was an utter failure. Not being proficient in python, needing to install a bunch of python packages, different error lingo, were quite discouraging. That said, it‚Äôs always good to try something and fail, and then pick it up again some other time and invest more time chunks into learning the individual portions of it. This is exactly what happened! I‚Äôm glad that it did and now I have a better understanding of it.

What really catalyzed this learning process was the recent AI Summit Conference. They provided a `Prompt Enigeering` beginner session and that really helped me to want to learn more about LLM. However, most LLM sessions, books, all involve paid version of API such as OpenAI GPT3.5/4o, Claude, Azure, etc, I wanted something local and does not involve paying for each token, in my case erroneous token ü§£, sent to the API and get charged for my mistakes. Then, we stumbled upon [GPT4All](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all). This was really something that kicked start the process of learning without requiring ANY codes! Just download it, and it has a GUI, attach local files, and then chat away, without internet!

Below is a GIF of the website and a snapshot of the GUI
![](gpt4all.gif)

We won‚Äôt be going through the details of using GPT4All here, it is quite intuitive. They also have a [discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/mGZE39AS3e) if you have questions. Very nice and helpful people. I recently learnt that GPT4All does not have embedding implemented yet on the python SDK through the channel. The most straightforward way to learn how to run LLM locally is this in 3 simple ways:

1.  Download the app
2.  Open the app, select model to download
3.  Attach folder on LocalDoc (this can be tricky if document is too large/long, but if you use nomic.ai‚Äôs embedding, which requires sign up and API key, it‚Äôs very fast).
4.  Then start chat, attach the LocalDoc folder of interest, and start chatting!

You will also need to change setting of `n_ctx` (tokens that can be sent) and `max_tokens` (tokens that LLM returns response) if your question is long or want longer answer. I did not tweak other things in here much, I didn‚Äôt find the response was much accurate, though it‚Äôs quick. Since it doesn‚Äôt allow a whole lots of customization, I went to `LangChain` instead since mainstream uses this a lot and I can find more tutorial in that setting. However, this really got me started and am forever grateful I found this and its community. Another thing that the community pointed out was that if the prompt template has something like

    ### Human:
    %1

    ### Assistant:

That‚Äôs not the right template, more so a placeholder and you‚Äôd have to enter the model specific prompt template for it to work, such as for Llama 3 system prompt template.

    <|im_start|>system
    Write your system prompt here<|im_end|>

With LangChain, you don‚Äôt need the above, most of them are done for you! More to come.

## ü¶ú‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•LangChain

The reasons I chose LangChain to learn were because of standardization of the lingo, functions, workflow etc. It reminds me a whole lot of `TidyModels`. It has a specific workflow, but incorporates all the cool engines (ML methods) into the workflow. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre using Llama 3, WizardLM, Gemma2 etc, the workflow, functions are all the same. Also, there are lot of resources out there that uses this and that is extremely helpful for me to start. Not to mention, the documentation of LangChain is fantastic! Because this field is evolving so swiftly some of the tutorial codes are deprecated but the documentations offer the current function and points you to the right direction. Definitely enjoyed reading through it when I stumbled upoen problem. ‚ù§Ô∏è

That said, it does not come without LOTS and LOTS of trial and error. Below I‚Äôll try to document the things I need for this to run on R. It may not be extensive, but if you are stuck in any of the steps below please let me know, I‚Äôll try to see if I can reproduce it and help you troubleshoot if I can. Here, I am using `LlamaCpp` because it is an efficient, open-source C++ implementation of Meta‚Äôs LLaMA language model, designed for CPU-based inference. It allows users to run large language models on consumer-grade hardware with relatively low memory requirements, thanks to its support for various quantization levels

## Prerequisite

I assume you have python and reticulate installed, and your reticulate is pointing towards the python you use to install the following packages in python

    pip install --upgrade langchain langchain-community langchain_core langchain_huggingface llama-cpp-python faiss-cpu sentence-transformers

Sorry if I missed anything. If when you run the code you noticed some error where packages not found, you can use that to troubleshoot. Let me know if I missed anything, I‚Äôll modify.

## Code In Action - Explained

### Load Packages

``` r
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)

# load modules
langchain_community <- import("langchain_community")
langchain <- import("langchain")
langchain_core <- import("langchain_core")
langchain_huggingface <- import("langchain_huggingface")

# load functions
### Documents
DirectoryLoader <- langchain_community$document_loaders$directory$DirectoryLoader
PyPDFLoader <- langchain_community$document_loaders$PyPDFLoader
RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter <- langchain$text_splitter$RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
HuggingFaceEmbeddings <- langchain_huggingface$HuggingFaceEmbeddings

### Embedding / Vectorstorage / Retriever
FAISS <- langchain_community$vectorstores$FAISS

### Model
LlamaCpp <- langchain_community$llms$LlamaCpp
CallbackManager <- langchain_core$callbacks$CallbackManager
StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler <- langchain_core$callbacks$StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler


### Template
PromptTemplate <- langchain$prompts$PromptTemplate
ChatPromptTemplate <- langchain_core$prompts$ChatPromptTemplate

### Chain
create_retrieval_chain <- langchain$chains$create_retrieval_chain
create_stuff_documents_chain <- langchain$chains$combine_documents$create_stuff_documents_chain
```

This is quite self-explainatory. If you have questions, copy and paste on LLM and have it explain. Make sure to get your copy of [pdf here](https://www.idsociety.org/globalassets/idsa/practice-guidelines/amr-guidance/4.0/amr-guidance-4.0.pdf)

### Load & Embed Document

``` r
loader = PyPDFLoader("amr-guidance-4.0.pdf")
documents = loader$load()
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
docs = text_splitter$split_documents(documents)
vectorstore = FAISS$from_documents(documents=docs, embedding=HuggingFaceEmbeddings())
retriever = vectorstore$as_retriever()
```

Explaination:
- Loads the contents of the PDF file named ‚Äúamr-guidance-4.0.pdf‚Äù.
- Extracts the text content from the loaded PDF and stores it in the documents variable.
- Creates a text splitter that will divide the text into chunks of approximately 1000 characters each, with an overlap of 200 characters between adjacent chunks (to maintain context).
- Applies the splitter to the documents variable, breaking the text into smaller chunks stored in the docs variable.
- Initializes an embedding model from the Hugging Face library. Embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
- Creates a FAISS vector store (vectorstore). It takes the split text chunks (docs) and converts them into embeddings using the specified HuggingFaceEmbeddings model. These embeddings are then stored in the vector store. HuggingFaceEmbeddings model when not specified will return `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` model.
- Creates a retriever object from the vectorstore. This retriever allows you to efficiently search the vector store for text chunks that are semantically similar to a given query.

#### Embedding, huh?

Embedding is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to represent words, sentences, or documents as numerical vectors. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the text and can be used for various NLP tasks, such as similarity search, text classification, and language generation. In this case, we are using the Hugging Face library to generate embeddings for the text chunks extracted from the PDF document.

This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJxpyO3ei4&t=151s) has a great description of what embedding model -\> vector storage means.

#### Example of embedding vector

``` r
embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings()
embedding$embed_query(text="can i use gentamicin for pseudomonas infection")
```

![](embedding_vec.png)

Then this embedding vector will be compared with all of the chunk vectors using squared L2 distance (Euclidean distance):

`\(d(a,b) = \sum(a_i-b_i)^2\)`

The actual euclidean distance we need to square-root it but here FAISS has omitted it for computational efficiency. The lower the number the more similar the 2 vectors are, it works the same regardless of square-rooting or not. [More details on the proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3451864/is-correct-to-say-squared-euclidean-2-norm)

#### Return the Best (lowest squared L2) Similarity

``` r
vectorstore$similarity_search_with_score(query = "can i use gentamicin for pseudomonas infection", k=as.integer(1))
```

![](embedding_similarity_k1.png)
Now lets calculate it by hand!

``` r
query_v <- embedding$embed_query(text="can i use gentamicin for pseudomonas infection") 
page53_v <- embedding$embed_query(text=docs[[167]]$page_content) 
sum((query_v - page53_v)^2)
```

    ## [1] 0.7473773

YES !!! Same number, awesome!!! ‚úÖüôåüëç

### Model

``` r
llm = LlamaCpp(
  model_path="wizardlm-13b-v1.2.Q5_K_M.gguf",
  streaming=TRUE,  
  callback_manager=CallbackManager(handlers = list(StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler())),
  n_ctx = as.integer(2048),
  max_tokens = as.integer(1024),
  temperature = 0,
  verbose = F)
```

Explaination:
- Initializes a LlamaCpp object from the langchain.llms module
- select path of GGUF model (see below how to download)
- Enables streaming output, allowing the model to generate text incrementally and send it back as it‚Äôs produced, rather than waiting for the entire generation to finish.
- Creates a CallbackManager object, which allows you to register callbacks (functions) to be executed during the text generation process. StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler. This handler prints the generated tokens directly to the standard output (your console) as they are produced, providing a real-time view of the generation.
- Sets the maximum context window size to 2048 tokens. The context window is the amount of text the model can ‚Äúremember‚Äù and use to generate its output.
- Limits the maximum number of tokens in the model‚Äôs output to 1024. This prevents the model from generating overly long responses.
- Controls the ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù or randomness of the model‚Äôs output. A temperature of 0 makes the model deterministic, always choosing the most likely next token.
- Disables verbose logging from the LlamaCpp library. I disabled this to make it more aesthetically nice for the blog, you should set this to TRUE to see detailed output during the generation process.

#### How to Download GGUF models?

1.  Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&library=gguf&sort=trending), here I have pre-selected `text-generation` model and `GGUF` library for you
2.  Select a model that piqued your interest (try 7-15B param)
3.  Select ‚ÄúFiles and versions‚Äù
    ![](huggingface.png)
4.  Select a model to download and download. If the gguf contains part 1 of 2, make sure to download both parts and select the first part when you‚Äôre assigning the model.

Please note that certain LLM such as Llama, Gemma etc, requires you to request permission to use their models. It is quite straightforward, read through their policy, request it by filling out information, wait for approval then you‚Äôre in!

### Prompt

``` r
system_prompt = "
    You are an expert for question-answering tasks. 
    Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question.
    When answering, also make sure to state the reason or rationale for that answer.
    Then question that reason or rationale critically once with a sentence.
    Then provide an answer to the critical appraisal.
    If you don't know the answer, say that you don't know.

    {context}

"

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate$from_messages(
  list(
    tuple("system",system_prompt),
    tuple("user",paste0("Question: ","{input}")),
    tuple("assistant",""))
)

prompt
```

![](prompt.png)

Make sure the `system prompt` goes to `SystemMessage`. I had to debug this for sometime and finally realized that the `ChatPromptTemplate$from_messages` function takes a `list of tuples` in order for it to work. Found this out by reading LangChain documentation. üôå To be quite honest, I really find their documentation to be very helpful for me!

### Chain or Runnables ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•

``` r
question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, question_answer_chain)
```

Explaination:
- `create_stuff_documents_chain()`: This function from LangChain creates a chain specifically designed for question-answering tasks. Your model `llm` will be used to generate answers. `prompt`: A PromptTemplate that guides the LLM on how to structure its response. It sets up a chain that takes a question and some documents as input. It passes the question and documents to your LLM. The LLM uses the prompt to generate an answer based on the given information.
- `create_retrieval_chain()`¬∑: This function from LangChain creates a RAG chain. `retriever`: Your retriever object (e.g., the one you created from your vector store). This is responsible for fetching relevant documents based on a query. `question_answer_chain`: The chain you just created in the previous line, which will be used to generate answers from the retrieved documents.
What this line does:

Then, we are ready to ask our questions!

``` r
result = rag_chain$invoke(dict("input"= "What guideline are we looking at today?"))

result
```

![](test_result.png)
The output was saved in `result` as a list. As you can see, the first output was the question, 2nd,3rd,4th were the context that our retriever found most similar to our question. Lastly we have our answer ‚ÄúGuidance on the Management of Antimicrobial Resistance‚Äù ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚úÖThough it seemed to have missed ‚ÄúGram Negative‚Äù ü§£

#### Create A Vector of Questions

Let‚Äôs create a vector of questions and then run pass our LLM and see what are the responses.

``` r
questions = c("What is the preferred treatment of CRE?",
             "What is the preferred treatment of ESBL-E?",
             "Can we use fosfomycin in ESBL Klebsiella?",
             "Can we use fosfomycin in ESBL Ecoli?",
             "What is the preferred treatment of stenotrophomonas?",
             "What is the preferred treatment of DTR Pseudomonas?",
             "Which organisms require two active agent when susceptibility is known?",
             "Can we use gentamicin in pseudomonas infection?",
             "Can we use tobramycin to treat pseudomonas infection?",
             "Why is there carbapenemase non-producing organism?",
             "Can we use oral antibiotics for any of these MDRO?",
             "What is the preferred treatment of MRSA?",
             "What is the preferred treatment of CRAB?",
             "Can fosofmycin be used for pyelonephritis?",
             "Is IV antibiotics better than oral antibiotics?")

response = vector(mode = "character", length = length(questions))
source = vector(mode = "character", length = length(questions))


for (i in 1:length(questions)) {
  cat(rep("\n",100))
  print(paste0("Question: ", questions[i]))
  result = rag_chain$invoke(dict("input" = questions[i]))
  response[i] = result$answer
  source[i] = map_chr(.x=result$context,.f=~paste(.x)) |> paste(collapse = "\n\n##########\n\n") 
  Sys.sleep(10)
}
```

Explaination:
- `questions` variable contains a vector of the questions we‚Äôre interested in asking
- create `response` and `source` empty vectors
- create a `for loop`:
- clear console create by creatining lots of `new lines`
- print the question
- invoke the `i-th` question
- save the ith response to ith response vector
- save the ith source to ith source vector (this will tell us where the RAG got the source from our documents), separate each source with `\n\n##########\n\n`
- sleep for 10s, otherwise our machine will heat up quite fast; this also will help us capture screen of the response

Ready for the response? Let‚Äôs go! üèÉ

## Questions to Our LLM

Anything in baby blue highlight is LLM answer output, light green highlight is the source RAG found top 4 similarity to the question. If the `GIF` is too fast to follow, you can look at the actual output. I didn‚Äôt return all sources, unless necessary to investigate. The first question will have everything outputted.

Below might be a bit clinical, please feel free to glance through the first few examples and move on if you‚Äôre not interested.

### What is the preferred treatment of CRE?

#### Response:

![](cre.gif)

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"><br>The preferred treatment for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) that produce Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) depends on several factors, including the specific type of infection, the patient's clinical status, and the susceptibility patterns of the CRE isolate. According to the guidelines provided, the preferred antibiotics for such infections include:<br><br>1. Ceftazidime-avibactam, which inhibits KPC enzymes and other Œ≤-lactamases.<br>2. Meropenem-vaborbactam, where vaborbactam stabilizes meropenem against certain Œ≤-lactamases.<br>3. Imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, which combines imipenem with the beta-lactamase inhibitor relebactam to protect against KPC and other carbapenemases.<br>4. Cefiderocol, a siderophore cephalosporin that can access bacterial iron centers and maintain activity against many Gram-negative bacteria, including those producing KPC.<br>5. Aminoglycosides, which can be considered as alternative options for certain types of infections.<br><br>It is important to note that the choice of antibiotic should be guided by susceptibility testing results, and the treatment regimen should be tailored to the individual patient's needs. The continued use of a second agent beyond the initial therapy should be evaluated for additional benefit and potential risks such as increased likelihood of antibiotic resistance development.<br><br>Critical Appraisal:<br>The answer provided is based on current guidelines and evidence-based recommendations for treating CRE infections, particularly when KPC production is present. The rationale includes the use of antibiotics that have been shown to be effective against KPC-producing CRE, such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, cefiderocol, and aminoglycosides. These recommendations are supported by clinical studies and expert opinion.<br><br>However, it is crucial to consider that the treatment landscape for CRE infections may evolve with new data and emerging resistance patterns. Therefore, healthcare providers should always consult the most current guidelines and local antibiotic resistance profiles when making treatment decisions. Additionally, individual patient factors such as renal function, allergies, and concomitant medications must be taken into account to tailor the treatment plan appropriately.<br><br>Answer:<br>The preferred treatment for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by CRE that produce KPC, based on current guidelines and evidence, includes:<br><br>1.

Looking at output, it‚Äôs not too shabby. I did not specify exactly what condition and it picked out non-urinary source. When I saw aminoglycoside, it sounded wrong but it did say `in certain condition`, which it can be used in UTI/pyelo according to the guideline if susceptible, which also does not make sense in the LLM output as it already states `not urinary source`. As you can see from the last `source`, it did include `cUTI/pyelo` context.

> Note to self, More fine-tuning of the `search_type` might be helpful. Maybe set `k=3` ? Let‚Äôs continue to see the other responses.

### What is the preferred treatment of ESBL-E?

![](esbl.gif)

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"><br>The preferred treatment for Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales (E) based on the provided context is carbapenem therapy. Specifically, meropenem or imipenem -cilastatin are recommended as first-line treatments. Ertapenem is also an option, particularly for patients who need to continue therapy in the outpatient setting when oral treatment options are not available. After clinical response is achieved and if susceptibility tests confirm it, a transition to oral therapies such as trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole (TMP - SMX), ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin may be considered.<br><br>Critical Appraisal:<br>The recommendation for carbapenem therapy is based on a large clinical trial that showed a notable direction of risk difference in 30-day mortality favoring carbapenems over piperacillin - tazobactam. However, the absolute risk difference was attenuated and no longer statistically significant after reanalyzing the data with more stringent inclusion criteria (clinical isolates with piperacillin - tazobactam MICs ‚â§16 ¬µg/mL). This suggests that while carbapenems are currently preferred, further research may be needed to confirm their superiority, especially when considering the cost and potential for resistance development with widespread carbapenem use.<br><br>Answer to Critical Appraisal:<br>The critical appraisal raises a valid point about the reliance on a single clinical trial for the recommendation of carbapenems. While the initial trial showed promising results, the fact that the difference in mortality was not statistically significant after reanalysis suggests that there may be variability in outcomes. This highlights the importance of considering multiple studies and data sources when formulating treatment guidelines. Additionally, the potential for resistance development with carbapenems is a concern that must be balanced against the benefits of their use. Therefore, while carbapenems are currently recommended as first-line treatment, ongoing monitoring of clinical outcomes and resistance patterns is essential to ensure the most effective and safe treatment options for ESBL-E infections.</span>

### Can we use fosfomycin in ESBL Klebsiella?

![](kleb.gif)

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"><br>Based on the context provided, fosfomycin can be considered an alternative treatment option for ESBL-producing E. coli (EPEC) infections, particularly when preferred options such as carbapenems, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), or fluoroquinolones are not tolerated or do not show susceptibility. However, the data for fosfomycin's use against ESBL-producing Klebsiella (ESBL-K) is less clear. The context specifically mentions that fosfomycin is not suggested for prostatitis caused by gram-negative organisms other than E. coli due to the likely presence of the fosA gene, which can inactivate this agent. While fosfomycin has activity against some ESBL-producing Gram-negative bacteria, its use in ESBL-K infections should be approached with caution, and clinical outcomes data specific to this organism are lacking.<br><br>Critical Appraisal:<br>The rationale provided is based on the available evidence for fosfomycin's use against EPEC rather than ESBL-K. The context suggests that while fosfomycin can be used for EPEC, its efficacy against ESBL-K is not well-established. The presence of the fosA gene in organisms other than E. coli may reduce the effectiveness of fosfomycin against these strains. Additionally, the clinical outcomes data specifically for ESBL-K are lacking, which means that any use of fosfomycin in this context would be off-label and should be carefully considered within the context of individual patient circumstances and in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.<br><br>Answer to Critical Appraisal:<br>The critical appraisal raises a valid point that the evidence for using fosfomycin against ESBL-K is indeed less robust compared to its use against EPEC. The presence of the fosA gene in ESBL-K, which can render fosfomycin ineffective, is a significant concern. Therefore, while fosfomycin may be an alternative for EPEC when other options are not suitable, its use in ESBL-K should be approached with caution and only after considering the potential for reduced efficacy due to resistance mechanisms like the fosA gene. Clinicians should exercise judgment and consider consulting with an infectious disease specialist when treating ESBL-K infections with fosfomycin, especially in the absence of strong clinical data supporting its use.</span>

This is also quite interesting. It correctly stated that fosfomycin cannot be used for ESBL klebsiella but for some reason, it started off with, one can use it for ESBL Ecoli, even though the question did not ask that. Generally, the statements provided here seem accurate to me by glancing through.

> Note to self, i think `k=3` might be the magic number, as the last context does not answer the question either. The problem too is there are 2 `klebsiella` words in the articles and they‚Äôre not related to the treatment, it did use `k. pneumoniae`. So maybe if I switch the wording, it might be different.

While the provided answer is based on the most current data available at the time of the guidance, healthcare providers must stay informed about the latest developments in antimicrobial resistance and adjust their treatment strategies accordingly. They should also perform individual patient assessments to tailor therapy to each patient's unique situation. The guidance emphasizes the importance of not using combination antibiotic therapy once a Œ≤-lactam agent with proven in vitro activity is identified, as this approach has not shown additional benefits and may contribute to resistance development.

### Which organisms require two active agent when susceptibility is known?

![](combo.gif)

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"> According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidance, the benefit of using two agents for treatment may outweigh the risks in cases of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter (CRAB) infections, especially considering the high mortality associated with these infections. When susceptibility testing indicates that an organism is resistant to a single agent like ampicillin-sulbactam, it may be appropriate to use combination therapy with two active agents to improve outcomes. This is because CRAB infections are often resistant to multiple antibiotics, and using two agents increases the likelihood of covering the pathogen and improving clinical outcomes.<br><br>Critical Appraisal:<br>The guidance provided by IDSA suggests that combination therapy with two active agents may be necessary for CRAB infections when susceptibility testing confirms resistance to a single agent like ampicillin-sulbactam. However, this recommendation is based on the complexity of CRAB infections and their high mortality rate. It assumes that all CRAB infections are resistant to single-agent therapy and that combination therapy will always lead to better clinical outcomes. This may not always be the case, as there could be instances where a single agent with broader spectrum activity is sufficient and where combination therapy might increase the risk of adverse drug reactions without significant benefit. Additionally, the choice of second agents should be tailored based on individual patient factors, local resistance patterns, and the specific characteristics of the CRAB infection.<br><br>Answer to Critical Appraisal:<br>The critical appraisal raises a valid point that not all CRAB infections may require combination therapy, and there is a potential for increased risk of adverse drug reactions with the use of multiple antibiotics. The IDSA guidance does indeed emphasize that the decision to use combination therapy should be individualized based on patient-specific factors, infection characteristics, and local resistance patterns. The goal is to balance the potential benefits of combination therapy against the risks of adverse effects and the complexity of managing such treatments. It is also important to consider the latest clinical evidence and guidelines when making treatment decisions for CRAB infections, as resistance patterns and treatment options can change over time.</span>

As you can see here the response got cut off? Maybe it went over the `max_tokens`. But the output seemed to be quite confusing, one stated Pseudomonas, the other stated CRE in the same paragraph. IF you look at the source the most similar vector contained the correct answer but because we had split it using `overlap`, it included the last CRE text and beginning of Pseudomonas text.

> Note to self, play with overlap, reduce or set to 0? Typical practice is 10-20% of the token chunk size.

### Can we use tobramycin to treat pseudomonas infection?

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"><br>Yes, tobramycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that can be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including those with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR). However, its use should be based on susceptibility testing, and it is often recommended as part of combination therapy when a Œ≤-lactam agent alone may not be sufficient. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest that if no Œ≤-lactam agent demonstrates activity against DTR P. aeruginosa, tobramycin can be considered in combination with certain Œ≤-lactam agents like ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, or cefiderocol.

However, this approach may overlook potential benefits of combination therapy, such as the possibility of reducing the emergence of resistance or providing a broader spectrum of coverage against potential co-infections. Additionally, the rationale assumes that in vitro susceptibility testing is always accurate and that the MIC values are reliable predictors of clinical outcomes, which may not always be the case. There is also a possibility that some patients may have unique circumstances where combination therapy could be beneficial despite the lack of strong supporting data.<br><br>Answer to Critical Appraisal:<br>The critical appraisal raises important considerations. While the IDSA guidelines emphasize the importance of in vitro susceptibility testing and the potential risks of combination therapy, including increased toxicity and antibiotic resistance, it is indeed possible that there are scenarios where combination therapy could offer additional benefits beyond what current data suggest. The guidelines recommend a case-by-case approach, taking into account the individual patient's clinical status, the severity of the infection, and the potential risks and benefits of treatment. In cases where a Œ≤-lactam agent alone may not be sufficient to ensure effective treatment due to high resistance levels or other factors, the use of combination therapy with tobramycin could be considered, especially if there is a high likelihood that tobramycin will be active against the isolate in question. The decision to use combination therapy should always involve a careful assessment of the individual patient's needs and the potential risks and benefits of treatment.</span>

 Abstract  
 &#10;Background:  The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date 
guidance  on the treatment  of antimicrobial -resistant  (AMR)  infections.  This guidance  document  focuses 
on infections  caused  by extended -spectrum  Œ≤-lactamase -producing  Enterobacterales  (ESBL -E), AmpC  Œ≤- 
lactamase -producing Enterobacterales (AmpC -E), carbapenem -resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult -to-treat resistance (DTR P. aeruginosa ), carbapenem -resistant 
Acinetobacter  baumannii  (CRAB),  and Stenotrophomonas  maltophilia . This updated  document  replaces 
previous versions of the guidance document.  
Methods:  A panel of six infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial -' metadata={'source': 'llm-langchain/idsa_data/amr-guidance-4.0.pdf', 'page': 1}<br>##########<br>page_content='AST data are available.  
 &#10; 
Question  4.8: What  is the role of combination  antibiotic  therapy  for the treatment  of infections 
caused by DTR P. aeruginosa ? 
Suggested  approach:  Combination  antibiotic  therapy  is not suggested  for infections  caused  by DTR P. 
aeruginosa if susceptibility to ceftolozane -tazobactam, ceftazidime -avibactam, imipenem -cilastatin - 
relebactam, or cefiderocol has been confirmed.  
 &#10;Rationale  
 &#10;Although empiric combination antibiotic therapy (e.g., the addition of tobramycin to a Œ≤ -lactam agent) 
to broaden  the likelihood  of at least  one active  agent  for patients  at risk for DTR P. aeruginosa  infections 
is reasonable, data do not indicate that continued combination therapy ‚Äîonce the Œ≤ -lactam agent has 
demonstrated in vitro activity ‚Äîoffers any additional benefit over monotherapy with the Œ≤ -lactam

Rather, the continued use of a second agent increases the likelihood of antibiotic -' metadata={'source': 'llm-langchain/idsa_data/amr-guidance-4.0.pdf', 'page': 66}<br>##########<br>page_content='If no Œ≤ -lactam agent demonstrates activity against DTR P. aeruginosa , tobramycin (if

Not too shabby. Though the `yes` response was a bit optimistic in my view. According to the guideline, it‚Äôs used as a last resort when other beta-lactams are not susceptible. It did say that later on though.

### Why is there carbapenemase non-producing organism?

![](carbapenemase.gif)

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"><br>Carbapenemase non-producing organisms, particularly among Enterobacterales, can exhibit resistance to carbapenems through mechanisms other than the production of carbapenemases. These mechanisms include:<br><br>1. **Amplification of non-carbapenemase Œ≤-lactamase genes**: This can lead to increased production of enzymes that hydrolyze Œ≤-lactam antibiotics, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs).<br>2. **Outer membrane porin disruption**: The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria acts as a barrier to many antibiotics, including carbapenems. Disruption of porins, which are proteins that facilitate the passage of molecules through the outer membrane, can reduce the penetration of these antibiotics into the bacterial cell.<br>3. **Upregulation of efflux pumps**: These are active transport systems that expel antibiotics from the bacterial cell, thereby reducing their intracellular concentration and effectiveness.<br>4. **Mutations in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)**: PBPs are essential for bacterial cell wall synthesis. Mutations can lead to altered PBPs that have a reduced affinity for carbapenems, thus reducing the antibiotic's ability to inhibit cell wall synthesis.<br>5. **Presence of expanded-spectrum Œ≤-lactamases (e.g., bla OXA-10)**: These enzymes can hydrolyze a broad range of Œ≤-lactams, including carbapenems.<br><br>The prevalence of non-carbapenemase producing CRE is variable and can be influenced by geographic location, healthcare settings, and the prevalent resistance mechanisms in the local microbial ecosystem.<br><br>**Critical Appraisal**: <br>While it is true that non-carbapenemase producing organisms can exhibit carbapenem resistance through various mechanisms, the initial explanation might imply that carbapenemase production is a less common or secondary pathway to resistance. However, carbapenemases are a significant and growing cause of carbapenem resistance, especially in certain regions and healthcare settings. The emphasis on non-carbapenemase producing mechanisms should not overshadow the importance of carbapenemase-producing organisms, which can be highly resistant and pose a significant public health threat.<br><br>**Answer to Critical Appraisal**: <br>You are correct that my previous explanation might have understated the significance of carbapenemase-producing organisms.

 Section 3: Carbapenem -Resistant  Enterobacterales  
 &#10;CRE are defined  as members  of the Enterobacterales  order  resistant  to at least  one carbapenem 
antibiotic  (i.e.,  ertapenem,  meropenem,  imipenem,  doripenem)  or producing  a carbapenemase  enzyme  
214. Resistance  to at least  one carbapenem  other  than  imipenem  is required  for bacteria  intrinsically  less 
susceptible to imipenem (e.g., Proteus spp., Morganella spp., Providencia spp.)214.

resistance, broadly divided into those that are not carbapenemase -producing and those that are

Not too shabby. I was intending to ask for CRE but in this setting, the LLM accurately answered the question by including CR-PsA. Wow, this is not a bad way of refining our questions to be more concise and precise.

Let‚Äôs see if I only indicate CRE whether it will give a different answer.

### Can we use oral antibiotics for any of these MDRO?

![](oral_cre.gif)

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"> The question pertains to the use of oral antibiotics for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), particularly for infections caused by difficult-to-treat pathogens like DTR Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and other MDROs.<br><br>The use of oral antibiotics for MDRO infections depends on several factors:<br><br>1. **Susceptibility Testing**: The organism must be susceptible to an oral agent. This is determined through laboratory testing, such as antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST).<br><br>2. **Clinical Stability**: The patient must be clinically stable, meaning they are not in septic shock or other life-threatening conditions that require intravenous (IV) administration for immediate effect.<br><br>3. **Availability of AST Data**: There should be available data from AST to guide the choice of an oral agent.<br><br>4. **Drug Efficacy and Pharmacokinetics**: The oral medication must have adequate bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, and excretion to effectively treat the infection at the site of infection.<br><br>5. **Patient Compliance and Convenience**: Oral therapy is generally more convenient for patients, which can improve compliance with treatment regimens.<br><br>6. **Infection Site and Severity**: Some infections may not be amenable to oral therapy due to the severity or location of the infection.<br><br>For DTR Pseudomonas aeruginosa, if susceptibility to appropriate oral agents is confirmed (such as ceftazidime-avibactam, cefiderocol, or others), and all other criteria are met, transitioning to oral therapy can be considered. The same applies to CRE infections where the organism is susceptible to oral agents.<br><br>It's important to note that the decision to switch from IV to oral antibiotics should always be made on a case-by-case basis, considering the individual patient's circumstances and in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist when possible. The most current guidelines and recommendations should be followed, as they are regularly updated to reflect new evidence and changing patterns of resistance.<br><br>**Rationale Critique**: While the suggested approach for transitioning to oral therapy is reasonable, it's important to critically evaluate the potential risks associated with switching from IV to oral antibiotics. These include the possibility of suboptimal drug levels at the site of infection, patient non-compliance, and the emergence of resistance due to incomplete eradication of the pathogen. Additionally, some patients may have contraindications or adverse reactions to oral medications that were not present with IV therapy.<br><br>**Critical Appraisal Response**: The critique raises valid concerns about the transition from IV to oral antibiotics. However, when the criteria for oral therapy are met, and the patient is closely monitored, the benefits of improved patient comfort, convenience, and potentially better adherence to treatment can outweigh these risks. It is crucial that the choice of oral agent is based on reliable AST data and that the patient's response to therapy is carefully monitored for any signs of treatment failure or the development of resistance. The decision to switch to oral therapy should be made in collaboration with a healthcare provider experienced in managing MDRO infections.<br><br>**Answer**: Oral antibiotics can be used for some MDRO infections, provided that the organism is susceptible to the oral agent, the patient is clinically stable, and there is available AST data supporting the choice of oral medication. The decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, considering all relevant factors and in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist when possible.</span>

 Introduction  
 &#10;Antimicrobial -resistant (AMR) infections are  a global  crisis. Internationally,  approximately  1.3 
million deaths were estimated to be directly attributable to AMR pathogens in 20191. In the United 
States,  AMR  pathogens  caused  more  than  2.8 million  infections  and over  35,000  deaths  annually  from 
2012 through 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Antibiotic 
Resistance Threats in the United States Report2. 
As an alternative to practice guidelines, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has 
endorsed  developing  more  narrowly  focused  guidance  documents  for the treatment  of infections  where 
data may not be very robust and continue to rapidly evolve ‚Äì such as with AMR. Guidance documents' metadata={'source': 'llm-langchain/idsa_data/amr-guidance-4.0.pdf', 'page': 2}</span>

LOL ~! This is a test. There was no MRSA in the guideline, I just wanted to see what the response is. It‚Äôs not good. It did provide some possible antibiotics that work, but included ones that we know will not work. I suspect the answers came from trained data. Let‚Äôs explore the content to see how can I prevent this in the future.

### What is the preferred treatment of CRAB?

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"><br>The preferred treatment for moderate to severe infections caused by Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter (CRAB) bacteria involves combination therapy. According to the guidance document, the recommended approach includes a sulbactam-containing agent, with the preferred regimen being sulbactam-durlobactam in combination with either imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem. An alternative regimen is high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam (with a total daily dose of 9 grams of the sulbactam component) combined with another active agent, such as colistin, minocycline, tigecycline, or cefiderocol if sulbactam-durlobactam is not available. This approach is based on the limited data supporting the effectiveness of single agents and the potential for increased bacterial killing with combination regimens, despite inconclusive results from in vitro and animal studies, as well as observational studies evaluating combination therapy versus monotherapy.<br><br>Critical Appraisal:<br>The preferred treatment for CRAB infections as outlined by the guidance document is based on a limited evidence base. The recommendation for sulbactam-durlobactam in combination with either imipenem-cilastatin or meropenem is made despite the lack of robust clinical data supporting its efficacy. The alternative regimen of high-dose ampicillin-sulbactam also lacks strong clinical trial evidence. The reliance on combination therapy may be a prudent approach given the resistance profile of CRAB, but it is not definitively proven to be superior to monotherapy based on current evidence. Additionally, the use of combination therapy could lead to increased antibiotic exposure and potential toxicity without necessarily improving outcomes or reducing the risk of treatment failure or mortality.<br><br>Answer to Critical Appraisal:<br>The critical appraisal raises a valid point regarding the strength of the evidence supporting the preferred treatment for CRAB infections. The guidance document acknowledges that the data supporting the effectiveness of specific agents and combination regimens are limited. The recommendation for combination therapy is indeed a prudent approach given the high resistance rates of CRAB and the potential for improved outcomes due to synergistic effects or coverage against potential co-pathogens. However, it is important to note that while there is no definitive proof of superiority for combination therapy over monotherapy, the current clinical context, including the lack of single agents with consistent in vitro activity against CRAB and the high burden of infection, justifies the use of combination regimens as a precautionary measure. Ongoing research and real-world data collection are crucial to refine treatment recommendations and improve outcomes for patients with CRAB infections.</span>

Rationale  
The general  approach  for the treatment  of CRAB  infections  is to administer  combination  therapy 
with at least two agents for the treatment of CRAB infections, at least until an appropriate clinical 
response is observed, given the limited data supporting the effectiveness of any single antibiotic agent. 
It is also generally suggested that at least one agent in the combination is sulbactam -based. The 
preferred sulbactam -based agent is sulbactam -durlobactam in combination with either imipenem -

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"><br>Fosfomycin can be considered as an alternative treatment option for pyelonephritis caused by certain bacteria, particularly when other preferred or alternative options are not available or tolerated.

Additionally, the recommendation is specific to ESBL-producing E. coli and not necessarily applicable to all bacteria causing pyelonephritis, especially those that are likely to be resistant to fosfomycin due to the presence of the fosA gene.

So, we know that the first sentence is not true, even though it gave a reason for low renal parenchyma concentration. I suspect this is due to ‚Äúpossible‚Äù wordings use by the guideline.

I believe by including that 4th k with these context, LLM thinks that it may be ok, but the context is on switching from IV to oral.

### Is IV antibiotics better than oral antibiotics?

![](oral_v_iv.gif)

<span style="font-style: italic; color: #000000; background-color: #E6F3FF;"> The question conflates two different aspects of antibiotic administration: the route of administration (intravenous vs. oral) and the efficacy of antibiotics. Both intravenous (IV) and oral antibiotics can be highly effective, but they are used for different situations based on the patient's condition, the type of infection, and the specific pathogen involved.<br><br>IV antibiotics are typically used when:<br>1. The patient is severely ill or unable to take oral medication (e.g., vomiting, unconsciousness).<br>2. The infection is severe or life-threatening.<br>3. The bacteria causing the infection are sensitive to IV medications but not to oral ones.<br>4. The antibiotic needs to act quickly and has better bioavailability when administered intravenously.<br>5. The patient requires rapid therapeutic intervention (e.g., bacteremia, sepsis).<br><br>Oral antibiotics are usually preferred when:<br>1. The infection is less severe.<br>2. The patient is able to take medication by mouth and retain it.<br>3. The bacteria are sensitive to oral antibiotics.<br>4. The patient's condition allows for outpatient treatment.<br><br>Clinical trials and studies, such as those mentioned in the context you provided, compare different antibiotic regimens to determine their efficacy and safety. For example, the RESTORE-IMI 2 study compared imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam with piperacillin/tazobactam in adults with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and found that both regimens were effective but with some differences in safety profiles.<br><br>In the context of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a meta-analysis of 13 trials, including over 1,700 adults, found that nebulized antibiotics were associated with at least partial resolution of clinical symptoms of infection compared to placebo. However, there was no survival benefit, and other outcomes like ICU length of stay or ventilator days were not reduced. This suggests that while nebulized antibiotics might have some benefits in symptom relief, they may not be superior to standard IV or oral antibiotic treatments in terms of overall clinical outcomes.<br><br>Critical Appraisal:<br>The comparison between IV and oral antibiotics is complex because it depends on various factors, including the type of infection, patient's condition, and the specific pathogen. The meta-analysis mentioned indicates that nebulized antibiotics have some benefits in symptom relief but do not improve overall clinical outcomes compared to standard treatments. However, this does not directly address the question of whether IV antibiotics are better than oral antibiotics. The efficacy of each route of administration must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and the choice between IV and oral antibiotics should be guided by clinical guidelines and individual patient needs.<br><br>Answer to Crit</span>

Not too shabby!!!

## Limitations

- Hardware can be a problem (slow) if you download ?10 billion param models
- The above prompt is not generalizable to other models

## Opportunities for Improvement

Wow, that was a lot! But it was fun and educational! I can absolutely see the potential of RAG LLM, knowing the intricacy of it, to produce a tool to enhance knowledge. Here are a few things I will attempt to incorporate and learn moving forward:

- Learn to use LangSmith to check the details of the machine
- Learn LangGraph to create a workflow
- Use agents to help with better RAG
- Need to figure out how to work llama3 prompt template. I may have to use `Template` instead and pass on the actual llama3 provided template
- Try different embedding models, apparently HuggingFace has a leaderboard on [this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)
- Try LangSmith Hub Prompt [here](https://smith.langchain.com/hub?ref=blog.langchain.dev)
- Design the script to point directly to website for most updated guideline since this is a living document
- Going to give Mandell NLP a redesign! We‚Äôll see if it will work. [Here is my previous ngram work](http://localhost:4321/blog/mandell/)

## Lessons Learnt

- Learnt reticulate: dict, tuples, list, etc. [Here is a primer](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_primer.html), coupled with LangChain documentation it will tell me which argument takes what object
- LangChain Documentation is actually really good !!! Even for a beginner like me
- It is good to know both R and Python! The more I think about this, the more it makes sense to try Positron, though I did everything here on Rstudio without issues
