### My 2025 New Year Resolutions
- Explore Gimp
- ~~Explore useful VIM key binding~~ 
- ~~Learn nodejs, javascript, fasthtml, fashapi, plumber to create a simple tool for calling API and storing data~~ 
- ~~Explore and implement LLM-assisted learning scenarios for eval score calibration (DE Level 3)~~
- ~~re-create automation at wrk~~
- ~~?sti dashboard~~ 
- ~~Complete my neural network study. This time we're getting close!~~
- Practice 华语
- Dive into McElReath's Statistical Rethinking 2nd time
- ~~Maintain coaching skill and practice more! ?reach out to CECM for 2~~ 
- Finish 2 manuscripts

I did explore gimp a little bit but not enough to strike that off the list. We'll see if I'll resume that in 2026. One thing I found that often times it's not the initial action that made me commit to learning something but usually it's the second, third, or even fourth time with long period in between that brings me closer to understanding certain things. Or at least the illusion of understanding, that is. 🤣

I did start using vim key binding. Thanks Alec for the motivation! I need to get better this year for sure! With regards to plumber API, we did explore that! Wrote 2 blogs on it too! [here](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/plumber/) and [here](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/qbank/). 

Quite satisfied with some of the completion in 2025, LLM-assisted scenarios, completed neural network study, re-created automation, sti dashboard, maintaing coaching skill, prepared 1 manuscript instead of 2. Let's work on that in 2026!

Something that I wasn't expecting in 2025 was a year of diving head on into bioinformatics. Wow, I thought it was just 1 or 2 blogs but no, the various topics, the interesting math and methods behind it, I just couldn't resist learning more and more of the surface of these topics! Very intriguing indeed! I did 8 blogs total on bioinformatics, and there are more that I want to dive into! Such as ampC, CRE, mec, vanA etc. Looking forward!

Things that didn't go as planned -> I started out ok with 华语 with duolingo but then got tapered off. Didn't really dive into Richard McElreath's statistical rethinking the second time. Did only 1 manuscript. Didn't put too much effort on gimp. Maybe better effort this year!

### My 2026 New Year Resolutions
- Explore molecular docking & medication discovery
- Explore more bioinformatics (e.g ampC, CRE, mec, vanA etc), 59 skill
- Use more parallel computing (at least once a month with `future` and personally built function for multicore)
- Build a computer cluster
- Explore simple quantum computing
- Use more tidymodels, keras and torch; I do think I'll be exploring more AI/ML models in 2026 due to research
- Git, can't get away from this
- Healthy life style
- Attend res conference at least 4x/month
- work research
- use more vim (at least cumulative 15 mins per week - try working on copy & pasting)
- Rewatch Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking, especially on Gaussian Process and ordered logistic regression
