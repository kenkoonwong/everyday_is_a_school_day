### My 2024 New Year Resolutions
- Data Science/Coding
  - ~~I'm going to devote more time in Python~~ Learnt [Polars](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/polars/) as well
  - Complete my neural network study. Almost!
  - ~~Learn more about conformal prediction and apply it~~ [ESICM 2025 Datathon](https://kenkoonwong.shinyapps.io/team3_maverick/)
  - Attempt to use tidymodels for all analysis and recipes to explore preprocessing techniques
- Statistics 
  - Continue my journey in Causal Inference
    - ~~Re-read Causal Inference and Discovery in Python~~
    - ~~Dive into McElReath's Statistical Rethinking~~ 
- Health/Wellness
  - At least 10 push-ups everyday with +1 every week
  - ~~No 75th1 on 854~~
- Soft skills 
  - ~~Establish "Coaching" questions~~ [link](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/coach5/)
  - Find out staff's favorite food, color, activities and **write it down**

Wow, what a year! We did devote a bit more time in python. Learnt polars in python, [stable diffusion](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/2024-09-01-stable-diffusion-3-in-r-why-not-thanks-to-reticulate/), [LLM](https://www.kenkoonwong.com/blog/llm-rag/), now we're venturing into fastAPI, all thanks to Positron where we can perform single line/chunk code execution really helps me understand the underlying structure and function of the script. That's definitely a win! 

I also was not expecting us to learn more about conformal prediction but the datathon really pushed us to look into this much deeper. At least we learn the surface of conformal prediction on how it works, which is fascinating! The book [Introduction To Conformal Prediction With Python: A Short Guide For Quantifying Uncertainty Of Machine Learning Models](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Conformal-Prediction-Python-Quantifying/dp/B0BW2X919P/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1ETVN9QJD72IY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.07sxy5e_q0yX8Xb_Uo9VW8vZ9Q5e9E7UfW1SqtTk0-kpLEW-mIXrYaNN6QeAzMcUtqU8LiHfJYM5GpYKz_uvvsppSLU2B0t0_GBcZHhq9o1nRswYirxNifTM8849TG9uTkMj0FdtT5qIrwZL08HfEVM4NjMyT1FRvD_RfJZ_EZ4qIFVS2BAF2SP2XrcWMh0n0TKwVkvbssXCJc6XElXVOg.GUuX-Ag1lkStnav53nwNklLnCfBbpZb59t7B2Mc3zaQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=conformal+prediction&qid=1735745543&sprefix=conformal+prediction%2Caps%2C116&sr=8-3) was really helpful! Also [Anastasio's Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nql000Lu_iE&t=75s) have been beneficial as well. At least for me, I had to re-read and re-watch all of the video, code it, to understand the surface of the theory. Really glad we did it! 

I finally finished watching McElReath's Statistical Rethinking! What a great course. I will need to rewatch it this year to get a bit more solidification in Gaussian Process, etc. 

Last but not least, very thankful that we were able to finish all those coaching books and wrote notes about it and also practiced it with peer coaching.

Something I was not expecting was the involvement of IDSky in Bluesky. Got a bit more closer with ATproto, still don't completely understand it but it opened up the experience in creating a simple API, which is very exciting!
