>My father told me, “Invest in yourself now for ease when you’re older.” I knew what he meant at the time but didn’t appreciate it until a few years later ... Since then, I’ve incorporated Tai chi into my daily routine and promoted this exercise to my older patients. 

It was a privilege for CLOSLER to invite me to write an article about Tai Chi and how that influences my patient care.

Below are a few pictures of my family and me having fun taking photos while doing Tai chi. Too bad we were not able to format the photos to match the root aesthetic of the website. Nevertheless, here they are!
